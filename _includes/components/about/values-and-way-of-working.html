            <p>Honesty, transparency, and a no-ego approach to leadership have helped
              our team form an incredibly strong bond while building an industry-leading
              product.</p>
            <p>
              Our values are our guiding principles, internally and externally. In order to walk the walk and not just talk the talk, we give it our best to make our values the true North Star in everything we do, including policy-making as well as operations routines (e.g. all of our career frameworks are based on the four values). We do hope that you will see yourself in the way we work!</p>
            <h5 class="display-5">Trust</h5>
            <blockquote><p>We trust in our people fully and instantly. We value the trust we build with our customers.</p></blockquote>
            <p>Trust is a core value at Ultimate. We lead through context, not control, and value autonomy, flexibility and the ability for any individual to take ownership and act to create value for our customers and company. We trust each other to deliver on our promises to colleagues and customers alike. We trust ourselves to set the bar high, to make our own best decisions, and to take accountability for any behaviour that falls short of this.</p>
            <h5 class="display-5">Impact</h5>
            <blockquote><p>We recognise and celebrate the impact of our team. We are driven by creating real value for our customers and community.</p></blockquote>
            <p>impact is about driving innovation through the actions we take and the results we create. At ultimate.ai, we embrace proactivity and we reject passivity. We fuel each other’s confidence because, together, sky's the limit. We value results over hard work and always prioritise to tackle the projects and metrics that matter most.</p>

        <h5 class="display-5">Customer Success</h5>
        <blockquote><p>We know our customers have unique journeys and define our success in terms of theirs. We build lasting customer relationships.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Customer success is embedded into Ultimate’s DNA. We seek out a deep understanding of our customers and value how that deepens our vision. Every team member contributes to our customer-first mindset through a deep understanding of our product, industry and vision.</p>
        <h5 class="display-5">Ethics </h5>
        <blockquote><p>We are proudly diverse and empower each other to be better. We commit to using our platform as a force for good.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Ethics is how we foster a diverse, inclusive and happy workplace. At Ultimate, our global team respects one another’s differences and works to cultivate a sense of belonging for all. We lean into our Nordic roots and practice a “no-ego”, transparent and open culture. We put our team’s needs before our own and are always ready to support each other. Just as we help each other and push each other, we also celebrate our wins together.</p>
